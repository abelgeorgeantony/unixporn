# Guide For Conky

To install conky:
```
sudo apt-get install conky-all\
```
Conky should be added to the list of startup applications to start automatically upon login. Open **Gnome Tweaks** app and in the sidebar you can find a section for adding startup applications.\
Conky is configured using a config file. A standard **conky.conf** file will be created at **/etc/conky/**. This file will be used if **~/.conkyrc** is not found. The file I use is present in the configs folder of this repo.
